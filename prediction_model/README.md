# Complete MLOps Bootcamp

This repository contains the complete source code and learning materials for an MLOps Bootcamp. It provides a hands-on approach to learning the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, from development and experimentation to production deployment and monitoring.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

This bootcamp covers a wide range of MLOps concepts and tools, including:

- **Version Control for MLOps:** Using Git for collaboration and versioning ML projects.
- **Python Package Management:** Creating, packaging, and distributing Python packages with `setuptools`.
- **Packaging Machine Learning Models:** Structuring a machine learning project as a robust, installable package.
- **Experiment Tracking:** Managing ML experiments, logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts with MLFlow.
- **ML Model Management:** Using MLFlow for model versioning, staging, and deployment.
- **CI/CD for Machine Learning:** Automating the build, test, and deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions.
- **Building ML Applications:** Creating interactive web applications for ML models using Streamlit.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Setting up a monitoring stack for ML systems with Prometheus and Grafana.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into modules, each focusing on a specific MLOps topic:

```
├── Build-ML-App-Streamlit/       # Code for building a Streamlit app for the prediction model.
├── Continuous-Monitoring-Prometheus-Grafana/ # Scripts to set up Prometheus & Grafana.
├── Git-For-MLOps/                # Guide and examples for using Git in an MLOps context.
├── github-actions/               # Demo of a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
├── MLFlow-Manage-ML-Experiments/ # Covers experiment tracking and model management with MLFlow.
├── package-management-python/    # Examples of Python package management.
└── Packaging-ML-Model/           # A complete example of packaging an ML model.
```

## 🌟 Key Projects
